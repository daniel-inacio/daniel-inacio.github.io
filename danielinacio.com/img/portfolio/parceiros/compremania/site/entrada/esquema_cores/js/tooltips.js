	<strong>Monochromatic model.</strong>\
	This scheme is based on a single color tint, and uses only variations made by changing its saturation and brightness.\
	<p>The result is comfortable for eyes, even when using aggressive color. However, it's harder to find accents and highlights.</p>\
	<p>Monochromatic variations are made for each color in other schemes, too.</p>",
"csd3-m2" : "\
	<strong>Complementary (contrast) model.</strong>\
	The primary color is supplemented with its complement (color on the opposite side of the wheel). One warm and one cold color is always created – we have to consider, which one will be dominant, and whether the design should look warm, or cold.\
	<p>The Cores Complementares should be used carefully in the design, only as the accent, it shouldn't be overused.</p>",
"csd3-m3" : "\
	<strong>Triad (soft contrast) model.</strong>\
	The primary color is supplemented with two colors, placed identically on both sides of its complement. Unlike the \"sharp\" contrast, this scheme is often more comfortable for the eyes, it's softer, and there is more space for balancing warm/cold colors.\
	<p>You can set the distance from the complement. The less the angle is, the more similar the secondary colors are. For best results, the angle should be 15 to 60 degree. The exact value of 60 degree makes a special color scheme:</p>\
	<p><strong>The Triade</strong> is made by three colors evenly distributed the color wheel (by 120 degrees). The triade schemes are vibrating, full of energy, and have a lot of possibilities to make contrasts, accents and warm/cold balance.</p>",
"csd3-m4" : "\
	<strong>Tetrad (double-contrast) model.</strong>\
	This scheme is made by a pair of colors and their complements. It's based on <strong>the Tetrade</strong> – the foursome of colors evenly distributed on the color wheel (by 90 degreees). The Tetrade is very <em>aggressive</em> color scheme, requiring very good planning and very sensitive approach to relations of these colors.\
	<p>Less distance between colors causes less tension in the result. However, this scheme is always more \"nervous\" and \"action\" than other schemes. While working with it, we have to take care of relations between one color and its adjacent color complement. In case of the Tetrade (angle 90°), good feeling and very sensitive approach are necessary.</p>",
"csd3-m5" : "\
	<strong>Analogic model.</strong>\
	This scheme is made by the primary color and its adjacent colors – two colors identically on both sides. It always looks very elegantly and clear, the result has less tension and it's uniformly warm, or cold. If a color on the warm-cold border is chosen, the color with opposite \"temperature\" may be used for accenting the other two colors.\
	<p>You can set the distance of adjacent (secondary) colors, the angle shouldn't exceed 60 degree.</p>",
"csd3-m6" : "\
	<strong>Accented analogic model.</strong>\
	This is the Analogic model with complementary (contrast) color added. It must be treated as a complement only – it adds tension to the palette, and it's too aggressive when overused. However, used in details and as the accent, it can be very effective and elegant.",
